# PyTorch ROCm DevContainer
A simple and straight forward PyTorch ROCm DevContainer with CuPy support. Useful for ML and AI workloads on AMD GPUs. Initially made to work with SpaCy.

### Settings
All there is to configure manually is:
- The memory in the `devcontainer.json` file (currently set to `8G`).
- `HCC_AMDGPU_TARGET` and `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` in the `Dockerfile`.
- Any additional Python packages you wish to install at initialization in `requirements.txt`.
- For any packages that require NumPy or SciPy, it's a good idea to install them before CuPy. This is because CuPy will replace these packages with GPU-accelerated NumPy and SciPy equivalents.
